ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julia, AKA @ozmanda, a PhD Candidate working at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland. My research is focused on Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), and I'm fascinated by all things AI / ML. Follow my research group and me as we work on bringing AI to aviation and develop RL applications for critical systems: https://intelligentsystemsgroup.github.io/
